      <h4>How, why and when do people die in Mexico?</h4>
      <p>In Mexico, there have been important changes in the epidemiological occurrence of diseases, related to environmental, demographic, economic, social, and cultural changes, which have influenced the epidemiological profile, as well as the characteristics related to the presence of disease and death in the Mexican population.This has been described as a phenomenon of risk transition, since during the first half of the 20th century, the population was exposed to the inherent risks of a country in social development, characterized by poor hygiene and underutilization of health services, while in the second half there was a transition to health problems associated with development and urbanization. As a result, risks of exposure to a sedentary lifestyle, stress, tobacco and drug use, violence, as well as unhealthy eating habits have increased, resulting in high cholesterol and high blood pressure, factors responsible for much of the global burden of the disease. This transition has resulted in problems such as obesity and other chronic degenerative diseases at increasingly younger ages. Therefore, the objective of this project was to analyze the main causes of mortality in Mexico in the period 2012-2017, as well as aspects of death recorded.</p>
